						<p>Hello, I'm Monty Hall, the guy from the Monty Hall problem. If you've not heard of it, the Monty Hall Problem is a probability puzzle that seems so counter intuitive that even some mathemeticians have trouble believing it's true.</p>
						<p>The puzzle comes from a scenario on a game show I hosted, called <em>Let's Make a Deal</em>. Contestants would be shown three doors. Behind one of the doors was a fabulous prize, and behind the other two were not so fabulous prizes, usually a goat. Yes, an actual goat. Television was different back then.</p>
						<p>Contestants chose one door, and they would win the prize behind whichever door they picked. However, to make it interesting, after they declared their pick and before their door was opened, I would then show them what was behind one of the doors they did not pick. Behind that door was always a goat. Then, I gave the contestant the option to switch their choice from the door they originally picked to the remaining door.</p>
						<p>The Monty Hall Problem asks, "Do you get better odds of winning if you switch your choice to the other door?"</p>
						<p>There is a very clear answer to that question. You're going to get a chance to answer that today by running through the scenario a number of times. To keep track of whether it is better to switch or stay, we'll have another contestant who will always choose the same door as you to start and will always switch when given the option. This designated switcher will be called Clemens, and his scores will be seen besides yours.</p>
						<p>If you'd prefer to just find out the answer without making any choices, you can automatically run the scenario up to 10,000 times to see the winning percentages for switching versus not switching your choice.</p>
						<p>What do you say? Are you going to play, or do you want to run the scenario a bunch of times to see how it all turns out?</p>
